This guide is written by [Theo Tolv](https://iconara.net/). I've been working with Athena since its launch, and been a constant annoyance to the Athena service team for all that time.

After answering over a hundred [questions tagged `amazon-athena`][1] on Stack Overflow, I felt that there needed to be a place where the questions that come up again and can be answered. This guide is meant to cover the most frequently asked questions, and more.

## How to ask me questions

If you have Amazon Athena related questions the best place to ask them is on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com). I look at the [`amazon-athena`][1] tag frequently and answer all questions that I can.

If you have specific questions for me you can find me as [@iconara on Twitter](https://twitter.com/iconara), or find me by name on some of the AWS Slack channels, like [AWS Developers](https://awsdevelopers.slack.com), [Open Guide to AWS](https://og-aws.slack.com/), or [AWS Community Nordics](https://aws-community-nordics.slack.com).

If you find this guide helpful you can [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/iconara).
